# 8. If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’ again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?

a = 12
a = "dog"
print(a)

# Yes, variables can be reassigned to a new value that is a different data type from its current value. Variables are like empty box. When we assign it a value, the box can contain that value and when we reassign it, it will empty out the old value and the new value is placed inside of it.
